# Pickles.NetCore 

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ngm/Pickles.NetCore.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ngm/Pickles.NetCore)

This is a proof-of-concept to investigate porting [Pickles](https://github.com/picklesdoc/pickles) to cross-platform .NET Core.

It should be considered quite experimental at present.  Please see https://github.com/picklesdoc/pickles/issues/235 for further discussion.

I have built custom .NET Core versions of some dependent projects.  These are published at  https://www.myget.org/F/doubleloop/api/v3/index.json.  That myget source is included via the local NuGet.config in this repository.
